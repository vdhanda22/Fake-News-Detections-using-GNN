# Fake news detection using Graph Neural Networks
---

## üîç Overview 

‚Ä¢ Developed a GNN-based fake news detection model, achieving 95% classification accuracy on a
benchmark dataset through advanced graph attention mechanisms.

‚Ä¢ Optimized the GNN inference pipeline for deployment, reducing inference latency to <50ms per news item,
making it suitable for real-time applications.

‚Ä¢ Leveraged transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the GNN for multilingual datasets, extending the
model's applicability to global misinformation challenges.
